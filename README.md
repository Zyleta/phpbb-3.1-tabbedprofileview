# Tabbed profile view extension

## Install

1. Download the latest release.
2. Unzip the downloaded release, and change the name of the folder to `tabbedprofileview`.
3. In the `ext` directory of your phpBB board, create a new directory named `zyleta` (if it does not already exist).
4. Copy the `tabbedprofileview` folder to `/ext/zyleta/` (if done correctly, you'll have the main extension class at (your forum root)/ext/zyleta/tabbedprofileview/composer.json).
5. Navigate in the ACP to `Customise -> Manage extensions`.
6. Look for `Tabbed profile view` under the Disabled Extensions list, and click its `Enable` link.

## Uninstall

1. Navigate in the ACP to `Customise -> Extension Management -> Extensions`.
2. Look for `Tabbed profile view` under the Enabled Extensions list, and click its `Disable` link.
3. To permanently uninstall, click `Delete Data` and then delete the `/ext/zyleta/tabbedprofileview` folder.

## Add tabs

If You wanna add another element on tab, use event called 'memberlist_tabbed_view_tablist_prepend' (if You wanna add a tab on first from right position) or 'memberlist_tabbed_view_tablist_append' (first from left position).
To add corectly new tab do it like this:
<li id="{NAME_OF_YOUR_TAB}-tab" class="tab">
	<a href="#tabs" data-subpanel="{NAME_OF_YOUR_TAB}" role="tab" aria-controls="{NAME_OF_YOUR_TAB}">{L_NAME_OF_YOUR_TAB}</a>
</li>
and replace {NAME_OF_YOUR_TAB} with a name You would call this tab.
{L_NAME_OF_YOUR_TAB} is a displayed name on tab. It can be direct name, or can be from language file.
That's all what You did here. Now take a look at "Add content".

## Add content
If You added tab, You can add a content for it. Place it on event called 'memberlist_view_contact_after' or 'memberlist_view_contact_before'.
The code should looks like this:
<code>
<fieldset id="{NAME_OF_YOUR_TAB}" class="fields2" role="tabpanel">
	<div class="panel bg2 tabstats">
		<div class="inner">
			{YOUR_CODE}
		</div>
	</div>
</fieldset>
<!-- ENDIF -->
</code>
{NAME_OF_YOUR_TAB} have to be the same as on adding a tab. Class 'bg2' is just for better styling - same colour as others contents.
Class tabstats is just declared and coded, so it makes easiest to style Your code.
Class inner isn't needed, it is default on phpBB.
You can place Your code on place where {YOUR_CODE} is placed, it can be whatever You like, but You have to style it by Your own.
